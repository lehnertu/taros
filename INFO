 # show overview of files differing between master and linux_sim branches
git diff --compact-summary master linux_sim
 
 # show differences for a file between branches
git diff origin/master origin/linux_sim -- src/global.h

 # show the recent commits
git log --reverse --since="Feb 6 2022" --source

 # pull one file from a different branch
git checkout linux_sim src/logger.h

 # apply one commit from another branch
git checkout <branch to apply to>

 Display
 -------

Display is driven via SPI, connected to
    9 ... DC,
    10 ... CS,   PIN_SPI_SS
    11 ... MOSI, PIN_SPI_MOSI
    13 ... SCL,  PIN_SPI_SCK
clearing the display takes 282ms ?!
    96*64*16 = 98 kbit -> 350 kHz transmission
A) one should use the hardware acceleration instead (draw rectangle command #22h)
B) the teensy might provide a FIFO for hardware SPI connction
        we'd have to check if the display is ready before next write
C) the SSD1331 is capable of 150nS cycle time on the SPI interface -> 6.6 MHz 





 


 CPU details
 -----------
 
DWT - data watchpoint and trace unit
    The DWT if present contains counters for Clock cycles, CYCCNT.
    0xE0001000 - DWT_CTRL - Control Register
    0xE0001004 - DWT_CYCCNT - Cycle Count Register
    DWT registers are described in the Arm®v7-M Architecture Reference Manual.
ARM_DWT_CYCCNT is a 32-bit unsigned counter for processor cycles (600 MHz), defined in imxrt.h
